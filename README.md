# Topix Desktop

Topix is a social media platform for those who want to meet people with similar interests within their local area. The application encourages users with similar interests to meet in person. Each interest is called a “Topix” and can cover as narrow or as broad a scope as desired (e.g. “Sports” is a broader Topix. “Mountaineers” is a more distinct Topix within the “Sports” focus). Topix pages are populated with user-created posts in the nearby vicinity. User posts can be events, discussions, polls, and more.
